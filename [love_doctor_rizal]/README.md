With the widespread influence of social media come viral posts revealing gaps in knowledge regarding history. These incidents prompted people across social media to air their concerns about the country’s worsening academic crisis. The Philippines ranked last in reading literacy and second to the last in mathematics as well as science. Even before the pandemic, the Philippines has struggled with keeping up academically with the rest of the world.

This study sought to develop a historical visual novel that could promote learning through a positive game experience.

* Create a visual novel with Jose Rizal as the main subject;
* Develop a visual novel based on historical facts; and,
* Evaluate the visual novel through usability evaluation.

**Each one of the objectives were successfully tackled, and given solutions**
